# customer-service-desk-simulation
This C program simulates a Customer Service Desk using a Deque for complaints. It allows user sign-up/login for employees and customers, with unique IDs. Customers can add complaints; employees can view, process from both deque ends, and search complaints by ID. Linked lists manage users, and the deque enables flexible complaint handling.
